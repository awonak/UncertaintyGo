# ðŸŒ‹ Burst Generator

Excite the digital input with an attenuated trigger to generate even pulse width bursts from each of the 8 outputs. One pulse per output, so output 1 will not repeat, but output 8 will produce 8 pulses. With a 5v trigger, you'll get 10ms duty cycle bursts, down to a minimum 1v trigger which produces around 500ms duty cycle bursts. Bursts are one-shot and will not retrigger until all bursts have completed.
