# Uncertainty with TinyGo

This is my collection of scripts I have written for the Uncertainty eurorack module using TinyGo.

## Scripts

[voltage gates](voltage_gates/main.go)

This one was taken directly from the main Uncertainty repo and rewritten in TinyGo. https://github.com/oamodular/uncertainty#coding-the-code

[3 voice quantized digital vco](vco/main.go)

3 configurable VCO's using PWM to create a square wave and quantized to reduce noise/jitter when tuning the oscillators.
